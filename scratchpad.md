# Workflow

-> TDD?
- need to simulate interaction with fake target
- need to learn and integrate + maintain unit-tests
-> could be faster to test manually for now

# REPL sample

example interaction (over serial):

```
uLisp 4.5
12927> (+ (* 3 4) 2.5)
14.5
"some text-with
newlines"

12927>
--- exit ---
```

# next steps

- class to read ulisp prompt, extract avail cells

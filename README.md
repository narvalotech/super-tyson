# What

Super-Tyson (ST) is a micro-ide for [micro lisp](http://www.ulisp.com/).

# Why

Needed a project to learn me some C++.
Also ulisp is lacking a small IDE, something like micropython's [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).

# How (to use)

``` sh
# configure
cmake -Bbuild -S.

# build
cmake --build build

# run
./build/SuperTyson
```
